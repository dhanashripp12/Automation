we need to store our code in one of the repository 

bitbucket/github/gitlab -

they have multiple option where any of the team member can review the code and they put any comment as well  and
 if any thing they want to edit they can edit as well - we can run our code with the help of git hub action as well or we can connect wit
 ci/cd pipeline
 
 
 we need to run our code from jenkins as well 
 
 what is jenkins - jenkins is a CI /Cd tool - continues integration and deployment tool
 
 
 Dev Environment - that mean the url of developer is different
 
 when application and some feature is developed in dev environment they will move to QA person for testing
 
 Qa person will test the application on Testing Environment - UAT Environment - Production - Live 
 
 jenkins will execute our scenario with the help of pom.xml only
 
 
 
 jenkins - pom.xml - .testng.xml - scripting - main functionaliy - page object model
